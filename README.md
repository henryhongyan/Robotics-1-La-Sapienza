# Robotics 1 La Sapienza

Here's the material to solve Robotics 1 exercises: explaination, code and examples.

## Index

### Orientation

- Given the orientation in two ways, compute the initial orientation wrt reference frame and exprime it with a set of angles.
  - <a href='https://github.com/theroggio/Robotics-1-La-Sapienza/blob/master/exercises/orientation/Ex1.md'> Ex 1 </a>

- In this configuration, what's the orientation of last frame?

### Denavit-Hartenberg 

- Is this matrix generated by DH parameters? Why? 
  - <a href='https://github.com/theroggio/Robotics-1-La-Sapienza/blob/master/exercises/Denavit-Hartenberg/Ex1.md'> Ex 1 </a>

- Table of DH parameters.
  - <a href='https://github.com/theroggio/Robotics-1-La-Sapienza/blob/master/exercises/Denavit-Hartenberg/Ex2.md'> 7R Anthropomorphic </a>

- Transformation matrix between frame A to frame B. 
  - <a href='https://github.com/theroggio/Robotics-1-La-Sapienza/blob/master/exercises/Denavit-Hartenberg/Ex3.md'> Ex 1 </a>

### Motor 

- Application of DC motor laws.
  - <a href='https://github.com/theroggio/Robotics-1-La-Sapienza/blob/master/exercises/motor/Ex1.md'>Ex 1</a>

#### Reduction ratios

- Rotation speed given the mechanical structure.
  - <a href='https://github.com/theroggio/Robotics-1-La-Sapienza/blob/master/exercises/motor/Ex1.md'> Ex 1 - Harmonic Drive part </a>

- Incremental encoder. 
  - <a href='https://github.com/theroggio/Robotics-1-La-Sapienza/blob/master/exercises/motor/Ex2.md'> Ex 1 - Resolution | Pulses per turn | Pulses counted | Counter going up/down </a>

### Inverse Kinematics

#### Numerical methods

- Given two results of iterations, what's the method used? 

- If convergences, to what? 

- In what configuration Gradient Descent will stop? What happens if we apply Newton there?
