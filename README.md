# Robotics 1 La Sapienza

Here's the material to solve Robotics 1 exercises: explaination, code and examples.

## Index

### Orientation

- Given the orientation in two ways, compute the initial orientation wrt reference frame and exprime it with a set of angles: 

- In this configuration, what's the orientation of last frame?

### Denavit-Hartenberg 

- Is this matrix generated by DH parameters? Why? 

- Table of DH parameters.

- Transformation matrix between frame A to frame B. 

### Motor 

- Application of DC motor laws.

#### Reduction ratios

- Rotation speed given the mechanical structure.

- Incremental encoder. 

### Inverse Kinematics

#### Numerical methods

- Given two results of iterations, what's the method used? 

- If convergences, to what? 

- In what configuration Gradient Descent will stop? What happens if we apply Newton there?
