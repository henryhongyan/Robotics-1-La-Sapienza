# Orientation of point in different frames

Given displacement Pab. And Orientation of frame B with respect to frame A.

The point P in frame B can be written in frame A as

**P = Pab + R*P**

On the other way having the displacement of frame B wrt frame A, if we had P1 in frame A, we could invert the formula to use this same matrix transpose (we do not have rotation of frame A wrt frame B).

The orientationof frame 2 wrt frame 1 is given by R12 = R1*R2'
