## Exercise 3

Provide numerically the transformation matrix between base frame and frame 0. Robot is in the picture below:

Using the software to compute the trasnformation matrix (homogenous) we need the parameters (d,a,alpha,theta) from base frame to frame zero.

From the pictures we see that: **alpha** and **theta** are both equal to **0** (in fact the Z and X axes are in the same directions).

Distance **d** is along the Z axis, so it's the height of frame 0 wrt base frame = **0.346**. 

Distance **a** is the minimum distance between the two Z axes of the frames, from *bottom* picture we see it's **0.220**.
