## Worskpace 3R planar robot

With general length of the three links we can indicate with lmax the longest, lmin the shortest and lmed the last one. 

If two or more of them have same length it doesn't matter how this assignemtn is done.

The external boundary is always Rmax = lmin + lmax + lmed.

The inner boundary is Rmin = max{ 0 ; lmax - (lmed + lmin)},

## Secondary workspace

It's a annulus itself with inner radius = l1 - l2 + l3 and outer radius = l1 + l2 - l3.
