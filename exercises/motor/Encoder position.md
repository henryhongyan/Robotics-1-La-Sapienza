# Optical encoder on load or motor

If the optical encoder is placed on the motor it's easier to use but leads to less accurate measurements. It supports feedback ato solve some errors that can be due to acceleration, temperature, coupling, misalignment and when there's a cyclic behaviour also hysteresis.

If it's placed on the load the measurements are more accurate because it's like a direct measurement, so many of the errors occuring in the first case are vanished. The trade-off is with the cost and the complexity of the application and creates new failures point for the system.
