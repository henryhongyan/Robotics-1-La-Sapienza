# Absolute Encoder vs. Incremental Encoder

The **absolute encoder**:

- It needs no homing, at soon as you place it, it can start

- If power switch off it can save infos in flash memory or it can be used a special battery always on

- Errors for fast speed can be recover using grey code to have less confusing read at boundaries

- To read up to one 360Â° turn we need an external circuit 


The **incremental encoder**:

- It needs homing with the 'zero track' for the reference position

- If power switch off we need to restart it all from homing

- The quadrature detection can improve the resolution 

- The presence of two track allows to determine direction of rotation
