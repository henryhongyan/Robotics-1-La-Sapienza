# Jacobian analysis when not square

If the Jacobian is not squared we cannot compute directly the determinant. So to check when it loses rank we must compute its squared minor determinants.

For example a 3-by-4 matrix has 4 minor 3-by-3. To loose its rank all these minors should be equal to zero.
