## Exercise 5

### If the method converges, to what solution? 

To prove that the method converges we can compute the new error after the iteration **desried - new_guess**; if this value is smaller than the previous error the algorithm is converging.
The solution of the convergence need to be determined as a closed form solution. 

Inverse Kinematics in closed form for this problem is here: <a href='https://github.com/theroggio/Robotics-1-La-Sapienza/blob/master/exercises/inverse%20kinematics/Ex1.md'> solution </a>.

If there are more than just one solution we cannot know exactly to which solution we'd arrive without applying directly the algorithm.
