## Exercise 5

### If the method converges, to what solution? 

To prove that the method converges we can compute the new error after the iteration **desried - new_guess**; if this value is smaller than the previous error the algorithm is converging.
The solution of the convergence need to be determined as a closed form solution. 

Inverse Kinematics in closed form for this problem is here: solution.
