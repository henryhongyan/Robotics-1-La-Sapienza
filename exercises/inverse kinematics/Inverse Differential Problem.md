# Inverse Differential Problem

Given a mapping T between angular velocity of the body and time derivative of angles, and the values of angles (from orientation or from inverse kinematics problem) we can compute T with values (non parametric).

Then we need the angular velocity of the body **wd** to invert the problem, that becomes:

(dx dy dz ) = T^-1 * wd.
